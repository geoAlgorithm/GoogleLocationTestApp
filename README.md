# GoogleLocationTestApp
Simple implementation of an app using Google Location API with a background service. This APP needs a valid Google Maps API Key from Google API Console in order to use such feature, otherwise it will only display a list of locations. The purpose of this app is to compare it's results with Geoalgorithm's implementation in order to witness the difference in battery impact.
